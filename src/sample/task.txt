Task 8
Implement the L-system representing the growth of the plant (Fractal plant) for the following

parameters:
Symbols: X F + - [ ]
Initial word w=X

rules:
P1 : X -> F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X
P2: F -> FF
+ and – rotation by 25o
[ - push
] – pop
F – go forward and draw line
X – auxiliary symbol

Initial values:
X=0, y=0
Alfa = 25o
w0=X
generate wn , where n – numer of iterations
